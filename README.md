# OVMF Secure Boot setup helper files

A quick and small collection of files to aid the setup of the required crypto keys to enable secure boot on VMs using OVMF with that feature enabled.


(The firmware / OVMF build *must* have this feature compiled in and enabled for this to work!)

The `UefiShell.iso` file is from EDK2-OVMF.
